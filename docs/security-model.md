# Security model

## What PropSense guarantees (by construction and by test)
- **Fail closed.** Exposure needs a label, a matching floor and an allowlisted
  domain. Missing or mismatched anything exposes nothing.
- **Strict label/floor pairs.** A unit label on a common-floor entity, or a
  common label on a unit floor, exposes nothing. A tagging mistake alone never
  leaks an entity.
- **A fixed domain list.** Only light, switch, sensor, binary sensor, fan, scene and cover (and the climate blueprint) are handled. Locks, alarm panels, cameras, scripts and automations are not. The domain list is not an input.
- **Safer covers.** Garage, gate and door covers are blocked by default, and an unavailable cover is never exposed.
- **Commands are validated twice.** The broker ACL limits what a unit may
  publish; the hub re-checks the whitelist on every command and uses hardcoded
  services. The entity comes from the topic, never the payload.
- **Revocation.** Removing a label, area or floor clears discovery within
  seconds (debounce) and stops commands immediately.

## What you must still do
1. **Broker ACLs.** Replace the broker's default allow-all rule with
   deny-by-default, one user per instance, unique client IDs. See
   [emqx-acl-example.conf](emqx-acl-example.conf). Units must **not** be able to
   read or write device-bridge topics, discovery prefixes or other units.
2. **Test the denials**, not just the allows: publish a command for another
   unit's entity, and to another unit's topic, and confirm nothing happens
   ([testing.md](testing.md)).
3. **Keep privileged integrations on the hub only** (radios, locks, cloud
   accounts, controllers). Units need no token to the hub.
4. **Treat label/area edits on the hub as access control.** Anyone who can
   change them on the hub changes what a unit can reach.
5. **Review before exposing anything that matters.** This is pre-1.0 software.

## Scenes need care
A scene is only as safe as what it does. Exposing a scene lets a unit trigger
every entity the scene touches, and PropSense cannot check whether those
belong to that unit. Label only scenes whose contents are safe for that unit.

## Not covered
- A compromised hub exposes everything. A compromised unit can only read its
  own prefix and send validated commands.
- Cameras and locks are out of scope. If you add them, they need their own
  design (stream tokens, unlock auditing).
- Physical or radio-level isolation: units sharing one radio mesh can still
  affect each other's devices at the radio layer.
